# 🎬 Web-Based Code Animations  

Welcome to the **Web-Based Code Animations Repository!** 🚀✨  
This is a collaborative space where we explore the power of **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GSAP** to create eye-catching animations for the web.  

## 🎨 About This Repository  
This repository is dedicated to web-based animations, ranging from smooth UI/UX interactions to advanced scroll effects, parallax designs, and creative motion graphics. Whether you're a beginner experimenting with CSS animations or an expert crafting complex GSAP timelines, you’ll find inspiration and resources here!  

## 🔥 Technologies Used  
We primarily use:  
- **HTML & CSS** – Structure, styling, and basic animations (e.g., keyframes, transitions)  
- **JavaScript** – Interactive and dynamic effects  
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** – Advanced animations, scroll effects, and physics-based motion  
- **Other JS libraries** (optional) – ScrollTrigger, Three.js, Anime.js, Lottie, etc.
